# About my projects
---
**EduSoftware** - it is a Java project for my subject at the faculty: *Advanced Programming*. Me and my colleague made a learning application for *Graph Algorithms*. We used Java Swing for the interface. The link to the presentation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5V5sgKnLek

**Electron** - it is my first project for my faculty. It was for *Practice - Introduction to Programming*. The professor wanted to design an electronic diagram viewer, containing transistors, diodes, capacitors, power supplies, etc. The components can connect to each other and we added other languages for the app. We used graphics.h for the UI and C/C++. The presentation is in the folder (*Proiecte/Electron/Prezentare proiect.mp4*).

**LFAC-Compilator-LZ** - it is a project for the subject *Formal Languages, Automata and Compilers*. It is a compiler made by us.

**Liste simplu inlantuite circulare** and **Pasarea Flamingo** - these are small Web projects which I have made in highschool. They are not advanced, but I like to keep them because I want to remember from where I began.

**Monitorizarea traficului (Server Client App** and **ServerClientVar1** - these are projects for the Faculty for the subject *Computer Networks*. The second one is just an introduction project: to learn about forks, pipes and communication between processes. However, the first project is more complex. It uses multiple threads to communicate between processes. The purpose of the project was to make an app like Waze: you are the driver and the app tells them if you are going over the speed limit, if there is traffic, if there is an accident. Besides from this, it also shows about the weather, sports and the gas prices. I tried to simulate this app on my home city Iasi. The streets and the zones are real.  

**PLSQL Project** - this project is for my subject *DBMS Practice*. It is a application which the information introduced by a client is verified in the database. I used procedures, functions and triggers to validate and to return the output of the information. I wanted to make a Finding Friends app: a person can register and login to the app. They can also make friends with other people. The app also recommand friends like Facebook. Also, i wanted to add a small game like *Who wants to be a millionaire?* with questions about general knowledge. When a client wants to play, it creates a random test with multiple choices with random domains and only one correct answear.

**Revice** - this was my first Web app using APIs. The project was not made with frameworks. The backend was made with PHP and frontend with HTML, CSS and SCSS. Link to the presentation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igImHAM702Y

**Who stole my burger** - it was my first big project in highschool. It was made with other 5 classmates. We used Unity to make the game and we made ten levels. It is not the final project, there are some bugs, but I learned a bit about C# and the gaming industry. The story: The hero has prepared a legendary burger which he wanted to eat it. When he sat down at the table, he saw that it had been stolen from him by a villain. The hero will go through 10 levels to recover his burger and enjoy the legendary food.

**The Adventure of the Nameless Knight** - it was for my Attested in Computer Science in high school. It is also a game made in Unity and C#. It is the final product. The documentation explains about the game and the code (*Proiecte/The Adventure of the Nameless Knight/Documentatie.docx*). In the future, I will make a video presentation about this game.

**SmarthHouse Builder** - it is a project made with the whole group at my faculty. It was for *Software Engineering*. It is a web app which uses Flutter for Frontend and Java Spring for Backend. The link to the github is here: https://github.com/Al-Andrew/SmartHouse-Builder.
